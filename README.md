# Tutorial for Classification of Powder X-ray Diffraction Patterns

## NX School 2024 | Tutorial

### Summary

This tutorial demonstrates the application of some popular AI/ML-based tools to automate and accelerate an example X-ray experimental workflow. Topics covered include convolutional neural networks for classification of image data, integration of ChatGPT for streamlining the coding process, characterization of model training, and failure analysis.

### Getting Started

The recommended method for following along with the live demonstration is by using the Google Colaboratory version of the 'Classification_Tutorial.ipynb' notebook provided here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QINheEgHEQf6sgPhxAKDPaumtE4r0-fl?usp=share_link 
The Google Drive folder includes everything you need for the tutorial. Find the file called 'Classification_Tutorial.ipynb', right click on it, and go to Open with > Google Colaboratory. 

If you'd like to explore the tutorial and bonus questions further afterward, the notebook is available in this GitHub repository, which you can clone (click the green <> Code button for details) or download as a zipped folder. Please note that you will still need 'data.npy', 'labels.npy', and 'labels4.npy' files from the Google Drive, and in order for the current filepaths in 'Classification_Tutorial.ipnyb' to work, those data files need to be saved in the same directory as the notebook. 

For a different example of ML for X-ray experiments (similar format, different concepts), check out last year's tutorial here: https://github.com/ninarina12/NX-School-2023/tree/main
